#About Me
From the 7th grade, I really liked to study technical subjects. During my school years, I actively began to study chemistry and eventually became a member of Kazakh National team at international olympiads.

After leaving school, I realized that chemistry was not really for me. Because it became too boring with memorization, repeated stuff. By nature I am very creative person, and love to build new things. So when I entered Nazarbayev University, I decided to try programming since it always excited me in school. In my first year of study, I realized that I fell in love with programming, because it was my like my little corner where nobody could find me, where hours fly by like minutes and I place where I could reach my full potential of creativity.

The skills acquired in the Olympiad preparations have helped me a lot and gave me a good start in programming. Unfortunately, after 2 years of study, I took a break from the university, as I decided to develop my business, more specifically a tennis school. But now that I have automated everything, I decided to resume my studies and continue to create incredible things through programming.

Having a break gave me incredible experience and some ideas about what I want to build and who I want to see myself as in the future. I believe that my ability to study effectively, my hard-working skills, clear vision of the path, dedication, and other soft-skills will help me to achieve my goals and become incredible developer.
