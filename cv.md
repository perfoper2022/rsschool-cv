# About Me

---

From the 7th grade, I really liked to study technical subjects. During my school years, I actively started to study chemistry and eventually became a member of Kazakh National team at international olympiads.

After graduating secondary school, I realized that I was not liking chemistry at all. By nature I am very creative person, and love to build new things. So when I entered Nazarbayev University, I decided to try programming since it always excited me in secondary school. In my first year of study, I realized that I fell in love with programming, because it was like my little corner in this big world, where hours fly by like minutes and a place where I could reach my full potential of creativity.

The skills acquired in the Olympiad preparations have helped me a lot and gave me a good start in programming. Unfortunately, after 2 years in high school, I took a break, as I decided to develop my business, more specifically a tennis school. But now that I have automated everything, I decided to resume my studies and continue to create incredible things through programming. Furthermore, I realised that I became so hungry for new knowledge.

Having a break gave me an incredible experience and great ideas about what I want to build and moreover who I want to see myself as in the future. I believe that I have gained a lot of hard skills and soft skills that will help me to achieve my goal of becoming one of the greatest developers.
